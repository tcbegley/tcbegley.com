I enjoy programming in my spare time, and contribute to open source projects where I can. Most things I work on are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tcbegley). Some of the projects I have been working on recently include:

* [*dash-bootstrap-components*](https://github.com/facultyai/dash-bootstrap-components) - Bootstrap themed components for Plotly Dash.
* [*dash-google-charts*](https://github.com/tcbegley/dash-google-charts) - Google charts for Plotly Dash.
* [*cube-solver*](https://github.com/tcbegley/cube-solver) - A Python implementation of Kociemba's two-phase algorithm for solving the Rubik's Cube.

I have also contributed to:

* [*reactstrap*](https://github.com/reactstrap/reactstrap) - React Bootstrap 4 components.
* [*knowledge-repo*](https://github.com/airbnb/knowledge-repo) - Open source knowledge sharing platform.
