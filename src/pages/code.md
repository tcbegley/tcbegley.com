I enjoy programming in my spare time. Most things I work on are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tcbegley). Some of the projects I have been working on recently include:

* [*dash-bootstrap-components*](https://github.com/facultyai/dash-bootstrap-components) - Bootstrap themed components for Plotly Dash.
* [*dash-google-charts*](https://github.com/tcbegley/dash-google-charts) - Google charts for Plotly Dash.
* [*cube-solver*](https://github.com/tcbegley/cube-solver) - A Python implementation of Kociemba's two-phase algorithm for solving the Rubik's Cube.
