I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at [Meta][meta].

Previously I was R&D lead at [Faculty][faculty]. A couple of projects I worked
on in my time there include:

- A tool for detecting terrorist propaganda online using machine learning
  algorithms, built for the UK Home Office. Read about it
  [here][blackflag-article].
- A media monitoring application for Amnesty International. Read about it
  [here][amnesty-article] or [watch me talk about it][demo-day].

Previously I studied for a PhD in mathematics at the University of Cambridge
under the joint supervision of [Prof. Neshan Wickramasekera][neshan-homepage]
and [Prof. Felix Schulze][felix-homepage]. You can read more about what I worked
on on my [maths page](/maths).

I like coding in my spare time and contributing to open source projects. You can
see some of the things I work on on my [code page](/code).
