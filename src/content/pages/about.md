I am currently R&D lead at [Faculty][faculty]. At the moment our R&D team is
particularly interested in AI safety. I originally joined Faculty as a data
scientist. We work with a number of clients across many different industries on
machine learning and data science problems. A couple of projects I've worked on
include:

- A tool for detecting terrorist propaganda online using machine learning
  algorithms, built for the UK Home Office. Read about it
  [here][blackflag-article].
- A media monitoring application for Amnesty International. Read about it
  [here][amnesty-article] or [watch me talk about it][demo-day].

Previously I studied for a PhD in mathematics at the University of Cambridge
under the joint supervision of [Prof. Neshan Wickramasekera][neshan-homepage]
and [Prof. Felix Schulze][felix-homepage]. You can read more about what I worked
on on my [maths page](/maths).

I like coding in my spare time and contributing to open source projects. You can
see some of the things I work on on my [code page](/code).
