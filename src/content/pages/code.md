I enjoy programming in my spare time. Most things I work on are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/tcbegley). Some of the projects I have been working
on recently include:

- [_dash-bootstrap-components_](https://github.com/facultyai/dash-bootstrap-components) -
  Bootstrap themed components for Plotly Dash.
- [_dash-rq-demo_](https://github.com/tcbegley/dash-rq-demo) - An example Dash
  app using Redis and RQ to manage long-running background tasks.
- [_cube-solver_](https://github.com/tcbegley/cube-solver) - A Python
  implementation of Kociemba's two-phase algorithm for solving the Rubik's Cube.
- [_advent-of-code_](https://github.com/tcbegley/advent-of-code) - My solutions
  to various advent of code problems (work in progress!)
- [_tqdm-countdown_](https://github.com/tcbegley/tqdm-countdown) - `tqdm` style
  progress bars... but more exciting!
