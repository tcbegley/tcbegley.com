In his seminal [paper][bayes-paper] "An Essay towards solving a Problem in the
Doctrine of Chances", [Thomas Bayes][bayes] introduced a thought experiment
involving six balls thrown randomly onto a billiards table. This example is
often used in popular science as an introduction to the ideas of Bayesian
statistics, as it nicely demonstrates the difference between a frequentist
maximum likelihood estimate and a Bayesian point estimate. Having seen this
example before, I had also heard a claim that the Bayesian estimate is "slightly
better", without having heard a clarification of what "better" means in this
context. In this post I'll describe the problem and compare the two approaches
on simulated data.

## The problem

Let's begin by stating Bayes' thought experiment. This description is taken from
[The Art of Statistics][spiegel] by David Spiegelhalter (which is a very
enjoyable read):

Let's set up some notation so that we can discuss possible solutions. First
we'll denote the position of the white ball by $\theta$. The exact length of the
table is irrelevant, so we'll assume that $0 \leq \theta \leq 1$, so that
$\theta$ represents the proportion of the table to the left of the line. Since
the ball is thrown randomly, it is reasonable to assume that

$$
    \theta \sim \mathrm{Unif}(0, 1)
$$

Next suppose that we have $n$ red balls that we throw randomly onto the table.
The probability that any one red ball stops to the left of the line is $\theta$,
so the number $y$ of red balls that end up to the left of the line can be
modelled as

$$
    y \sim \mathrm{Binomial}(n, \theta)
$$

Our goal is to come up with the best possible estimate of $\theta$ given $n$ and
$y$.

## The maximum likelihood estimate

Maximum likelihood estimation produces an estimate for the unknown parameters in
a model by choosing those parameters that maximise the likelihood. In our case,
we want to maximise

$$
    L(\theta) := p(y | \theta) = \binom{n}{y}\theta^y (1 - \theta)^{n-y}
$$

Equivalently, since $\log$ is a monotone function, we can maximise the
log-likelihood

$$
    l(\theta) := \log(p(y | \theta)) = y\log\theta + (n-y)\log(1 - \theta) + C
$$

where $C$ is a constant independent of $\theta$. We can easily differentiate $l$
to find a local maximum at

$$
    \hat \theta_{MLE} = \frac{y}{n}
$$

In other words, the maximum likelihood estimate for the position of the line is
simply the proportion of red balls that ended up to the left of the line.

## A Bayesian point estimate

We have already specified our prior (uniform distribution on $\theta$) and
sampling distribution (binomial distribution on $y$), so all that remains is to
calculate the posterior. By Bayes' rule

$$
    p(\theta | y) \propto p(\theta)p(y | \theta) \propto \theta^y (1 - \theta)^{n-y}
$$

We recognise the right hand side as an unnormalised Beta density, and so
conclude that

$$
    \theta | y \sim \mathrm{Beta}(y + 1, n - y + 1)
$$

This gives us a distribution over possible positions of the line based on the
observed data. In order to turn this into a point estimate, we could require for
example that our expected squared loss over the posterior distribution is
minimised

$$
    \hat \theta_{Bayes} = \mathrm{argmin}_{\tilde \theta} \mathbb{E}[(\theta - \tilde \theta)^2 | y]
$$

which is in fact the same as simply choosing $\hat \theta_{Bayes}$ to be the
posterior mean

$$
    \hat \theta_{Bayes} = \mathbb{E}[\theta | y]
$$

In our case, with the Beta posterior this means that

$$
    \hat \theta_{Bayes} = \frac{y + 1}{n + 2}
$$

This is somewhat similar to the maximum likelihood estimate, but the modified
numerator and denominator means that our estimates are always pulled back
towards the center of the table. Most notable if $0$ of the red balls landed to
the left of the line, the maximum likelihood estimate is that the line is on the
left edge of the table, whereas the Bayesian posterior mean puts the line at
$1 / 7 \approx 0.143$, which intuitively seems more reasonable.

This difference is a consequence of the fact that the Bayesian estimate has
built into it the knowledge that we threw the white ball at random, and
moderates the chance of making extreme inferences like drawing the line right on
the edge of the table. This property is also more generally true of Bayesian
method: priors can help regularise our inferences, particularly when we have
limited data.

## Comparing the two estimates

To compare the estimates, let's do some simulation. Using NumPy it's very easy
for us to perform this experiment thousands or even millions of times.

```python
import numpy as np

def simulate(n_trials=1_000_000, n_red=5):
    # throw a white ball and n_red red balls onto n_trials tables
    white = np.random.random(size=n_trials)
    red = np.random.random(size=(n_trials, n_red))

    # count the number of red balls to the left of the white ball
    n_red_left = (red < white[:, None]).sum(axis=1)

    # construct the two estimates
    mle = n_red_left / n_red
    posterior_mean = (n_red_left + 1) / (n_red + 2)

    return white, mle, posterior_mean
```

We can repeat the experiment a million times, recording the true location of the
line, and the maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimates.

```python
white, mle, posterior_mean = simulate(1_000_000)
```

### Brier score

The Brier score is a [proper scoring rule][proper-score] that measures the
quality of probabilistic forecasts. Suppose we make a forecast
$0 \leq \hat \theta \leq 1$ that the next red ball will land to the left of the
line. We then observe the outcome $o = 0, 1$. The Brier score for this single
forecast is

$$
    (\hat \theta - o)^2
$$

that is, it's the square of the probability we assigned to the true outcome
_not_ occuring. If we made a forecast $\hat \theta = 1$, the Brier score would
be $0$ if we are correct and $o = 1$, but $1$ if we were wrong and $o = 0$! If
the true outcome is not certain, maybe a more conservative forecast would be
$\hat \theta = 0.7$ in which case we would get a score of $0.3 ^ 2 = 0.09$ if
$o = 1$ and $0.7^2 = 0.49$ if $o = 0$. In general, we minimise the expected
Brier score if $\hat \theta = P(o = 1)$, meaning our forecast is encouraged to
be well [calibrated][calibration].

If we make a sequence $\hat \theta_i$ of $N$ forecasts with corresponding
outcomes, the Brier score is simply an average over all forecasts

$$
    \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (\hat \theta_i - o_i)^2
$$

Why square the difference rather than take the absolute value? This is to
encourage proper calibration of forecasts. That is to say if an outcome occurs
70% of the time, the best forecast should be to assign a probability $0.7$ to
that outcome. If the score were the absolute difference $|\hat \theta - o|$ then
we are actually incentivised to exaggerate our confidence. If $P(o=1) = 0.7$
then a forecast $\hat \theta \equiv 0.7$ yields a score

$$
    \mathbb{E}[|o - 0.7|] = 0.3 \times 0.7 + 0.7 \times 0.3 = 0.42
$$

whereas

$$
    \mathbb{E}[|o - 1|] = 0.3 \times 1 + 0.7 \times 0 = 0.3
$$

so our expected score is actually lower for the worse forecast!

#### Brier score - results

I calculated the Brier scores for both estimates as follows

```python
next_ball = np.random.binomial(1, white)

mle_brier = ((mle - next_ball) ** 2).mean()
bayes_brier = ((posterior_mean - next_ball) ** 2).mean()

print(f"MLE Brier score: {mle_brier:.4f}")
print(f"Bayes Brier score: {bayes_brier:.4f}")
```

which outputs

```plaintext
MLE Brier score: 0.2002
Bayes Brier score: 0.1906
```

## Conclusion

While it did turn out that the Bayesian posterior mean wound up having a lower
Brier score, the difference was relatively small, so maybe it's not a compelling
reason to choose one approach over the other. It is however a nice illustration
of the fact that Bayesian inference is able to incorporate domain knowledge. In
this case the fact that we know the white ball was thrown randomly and so would
be equally likely to be anywhere on the table. The maximum likelihood estimate
doesn't account for this knowledge, and is therefore prone to extreme inferences
like estimating the line is right on one of the edges of the table.
