This is the source code for my personal website. It is built with [Gatsby][gatsby] and based on the [Hello Friend][hello-friend] starter.

## Development

Install dependencies, and the Gatsby CLI

```sh
npm install
```

Build development bundle with hot reloading

```sh
npm start
```

Build a production bundle

```sh
npm run build
```

Serve the production bundle

```sh
npm run serve
```

Updates are automatically published when new commits are pushed to `main`. Manually publish to GitHub pages with

```sh
npm run deploy
```
