I currently work for [Faculty](https://faculty.ai) as a data scientist. We work with a number of clients across many different industries on machine learning and data science problems. A couple of projects I've worked on include:

* A tool for detecting terrorist propaganda online using machine learning algorithms, built for the UK Home Office. Read about it [here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43037899).
* A media monitoring application for Amnesty International. Read about it [here](https://www.cio.co.uk/it-strategy/amnesty-international-cio-adopts-data-science-track-press-data-3671814/) or [watch me talk about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aZdJwY79OE).

Previously I studied for a PhD in mathematics at the University of Cambridge under the joint supervision of [Prof. Neshan Wickramasekera]() and [Dr. Felix Schulze](). You can read more about what I worked on on my [maths page](/maths).

I like coding in my spare time and contributing to open source projects. You can see some of the things I work on on my [code page](/code).
