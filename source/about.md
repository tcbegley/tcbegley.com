I am currently R&D lead at [Faculty](https://faculty.ai). At the moment our R&D team is particularly interested in AI safety. I originally joined Faculty as a data scientist. We work with a number of clients across many different industries on machine learning and data science problems. A couple of projects I've worked on include:

* A tool for detecting terrorist propaganda online using machine learning algorithms, built for the UK Home Office. Read about it [here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43037899).
* A media monitoring application for Amnesty International. Read about it [here](https://www.cio.co.uk/it-strategy/amnesty-international-cio-adopts-data-science-track-press-data-3671814/) or [watch me talk about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aZdJwY79OE).

Previously I studied for a PhD in mathematics at the University of Cambridge under the joint supervision of [Prof. Neshan Wickramasekera](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/people/ngw24/) and [Dr. Felix Schulze](https://felixschulze.eu/). You can read more about what I worked on on my [maths page](/maths).

I like coding in my spare time and contributing to open source projects. You can see some of the things I work on on my [code page](/code).
